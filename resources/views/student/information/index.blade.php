                    <h1>Anxiety disorders</h1>
<p>Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). <br><br>
These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. <br><br>
Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. </p>
<br>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: <br><br>
Feeling nervous, restless or tense<br><br>
Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom<br><br>
Having an increased heart rate<br><br>
Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) <br><br>
Sweating<br><br>
Trembling<br><br>
Feeling weak or tired<br><br>
Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry<br><br>
Having trouble sleeping<br><br>
Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems<br><br>
Having difficulty controlling worry<br><br>
Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety</p>
<br><br>
<p>Several types of anxiety disorders exist: <br><br>
Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. <br><br>
Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. <br><br>
Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. <br><br>
Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. <br><br>
Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. <br><br>
Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. <br><br>
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. <br><br>
Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. <br><br>
Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. <br><br>
Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. </p>
<br>


<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder: <br><br>
Trauma. Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders. <br><br>
Stress due to an illness. Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future. <br><br>
Stress buildup. A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety — for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances. <br><br>
Personality. People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are. <br><br>
Other mental health disorders. People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder. <br><br>
Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can run in families. <br><br>
Drugs or alcohol. Drug or alcohol use or misuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety. </p>
<br>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as: <br><br>
Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders<br><br>
Substance misuse<br><br>
Trouble sleeping (insomnia) <br><br>
Digestive or bowel problems<br><br>
Headaches and chronic pain<br><br>
Social isolation<br><br>
Problems functioning at school or work<br><br>
Poor quality of life<br><br>
Suicide </p>
<br><br>

<h1>Depression (major depressive disorder)</h1>
<p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. <br><br>
More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include: <br><br>
Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness<br><br>
Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters<br><br>
Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports<br><br>
Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much<br><br>
Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort<br><br>
Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain<br><br>
Anxiety, agitation or restlessness<br><br>
Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements<br><br>
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame<br><br>
Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things<br><br>
Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide<br><br>
Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches<br><br>
For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why. </p> <br>
<h2>Depression symptoms in children and teens</h2>
<p>Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences. <br><br>
In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight. <br><br>
In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction. </p><br>
<h2>Depression symptoms in older adults</h2>
<p>Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as: <br><br>
Memory difficulties or personality changes<br><br>
Physical aches or pain<br><br>
Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication<br><br>
Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things<br><br>
Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men</p><br>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>It's not known exactly what causes depression. As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as: <br><br>
Biological differences. People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes. <br><br>
Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment. <br><br>
Hormones. Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions. <br><br>
Inherited traits. Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression. </p> <br>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment. <br><br>
Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include: <br><br>
Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic<br><br>
Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems<br><br>
Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide<br><br>
Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation<br><br>
History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder<br><br>
Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs<br><br>
Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease<br><br>
Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication) </p><br>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life. <br><br>
Examples of complications associated with depression include: <br><br>
Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes<br><br>
Pain or physical illness<br><br>
Alcohol or drug misuse<br><br>
Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia<br><br>
Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems<br><br>
Social isolation<br><br>
Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide<br><br>
Self-mutilation, such as cutting<br><br>
Premature death from medical conditions</p><br><br>

<h1>Eating disorders</h1>
<p>Eating disorders are serious conditions related to persistent eating behaviors that negatively impact your health, your emotions and your ability to function in important areas of life. The most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. <br><br>
Most eating disorders involve focusing too much on your weight, body shape and food, leading to dangerous eating behaviors. These behaviors can significantly impact your body's ability to get appropriate nutrition. Eating disorders can harm the heart, digestive system, bones, and teeth and mouth, and lead to other diseases. <br><br>
Eating disorders often develop in the teen and young adult years, although they can develop at other ages. With treatment, you can return to healthier eating habits and sometimes reverse serious complications caused by the eating disorder. </p><br>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. <br><br>
<h3>Anorexia nervosa</h3>
Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa — often simply called anorexia — is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. <br><br>
When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. <br><br>
<h3>Bulimia nervosa</h3>
Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa — commonly called bulimia — is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging. <br><br>
During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories. <br><br>
If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. <br><br>
<h3>Binge-eating disorder</h3>
When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full. <br><br>
After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. <br><br>
A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese. <br><br>
<h3>Rumination disorder</h3>
Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. <br><br>
The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. <br><br>
<h3>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder</h3>
This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. <br><br>
The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems. </p> <br>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. As with other mental illnesses, there may be many causes, such as: <br><br>
Genetics and biology. Certain people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders. Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating disorders. <br><br>
Psychological and emotional health. People with eating disorders may have psychological and emotional problems that contribute to the disorder. They may have low self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior and troubled relationships. </p><br>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>Teenage girls and young women are more likely than teenage boys and young men to have anorexia or bulimia, but males can have eating disorders, too. Although eating disorders can occur across a broad age range, they often develop in the teens and early 20s. <br><br>
Certain factors may increase the risk of developing an eating disorder, including: <br><br>
Family history. Eating disorders are significantly more likely to occur in people who have parents or siblings who've had an eating disorder. <br><br>
Other mental health disorders. People with an eating disorder often have a history of an anxiety disorder, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. <br><br>
Dieting and starvation. Dieting is a risk factor for developing an eating disorder. Starvation affects the brain and influences mood changes, rigidity in thinking, anxiety and reduction in appetite. There is strong evidence that many of the symptoms of an eating disorder are actually symptoms of starvation. Starvation and weight loss may change the way the brain works in vulnerable individuals, which may perpetuate restrictive eating behaviors and make it difficult to return to normal eating habits. <br><br>
Stress. Whether it's heading off to college, moving, landing a new job, or a family or relationship issue, change can bring stress, which may increase your risk of an eating disorder. </p> <br>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Eating disorders cause a wide variety of complications, some of them life-threatening. The more severe or long lasting the eating disorder, the more likely you are to experience serious complications, such as: <br><br>
Serious health problems<br><br>
Depression and anxiety<br><br>
Suicidal thoughts or behavior<br><br>
Problems with growth and development<br><br>
Social and relationship problems<br><br>
Substance use disorders<br><br>
Work and school issues<br><br>
Death</p><br><br>

<h1>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h1>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. <br><br>
Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD. <br><br>
Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function. </p><br>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks. <br><br>
PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person. <br>
<h3>Intrusive memories</h3>
Symptoms of intrusive memories may include: <br><br>
Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event<br><br>
Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks) <br><br>
Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event<br><br>
Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event<br>
<h3>Avoidance</h3>
Symptoms of avoidance may include: <br><br>
Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event<br><br>
Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event<br>
<h3>Negative changes in thinking and mood</h3>
Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include: <br><br>
Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world<br><br>
Hopelessness about the future<br><br>
Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event<br><br>
Difficulty maintaining close relationships<br><br>
Feeling detached from family and friends<br><br>
Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed<br><br>
Difficulty experiencing positive emotions<br><br>
Feeling emotionally numb<br>
<h3>Changes in physical and emotional reactions</h3>
Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include: <br><br>
Being easily startled or frightened<br><br>
Always being on guard for danger<br><br>
Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast<br><br>
Trouble sleeping<br><br>
Trouble concentrating<br><br>
Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior<br><br>
Overwhelming guilt or shame<br><br>
For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include: <br><br>
Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play<br><br>
Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event<br>
Intensity of symptoms<br><br>
PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault. </p> <br>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>You can develop post-traumatic stress disorder when you go through, see or learn about an event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation. <br><br>
Doctors aren't sure why some people get PTSD. As with most mental health problems, PTSD is probably caused by a complex mix of: <br><br>
Stressful experiences, including the amount and severity of trauma you've gone through in your life<br><br>
Inherited mental health risks, such as a family history of anxiety and depression<br><br>
Inherited features of your personality — often called your temperament<br><br>
The way your brain regulates the chemicals and hormones your body releases in response to stress</p><br>
<h2>Risk factors</h2>
<p>People of all ages can have post-traumatic stress disorder. However, some factors may make you more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event, such as: <br><br>
Experiencing intense or long-lasting trauma<br><br>
Having experienced other trauma earlier in life, such as childhood abuse<br><br>
Having a job that increases your risk of being exposed to traumatic events, such as military personnel and first responders<br><br>
Having other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression<br><br>
Having problems with substance misuse, such as excess drinking or drug use<br><br>
Lacking a good support system of family and friends<br><br>
Having blood relatives with mental health problems, including anxiety or depression<br><br>
Kinds of traumatic events
The most common events leading to the development of PTSD include: <br><br>
Combat exposure<br><br>
Childhood physical abuse<br><br>
Sexual violence<br><br>
Physical assault<br><br>
Being threatened with a weapon<br><br>
An accident<br><br>
Many other traumatic events also can lead to PTSD, such as fire, natural disaster, mugging, robbery, plane crash, torture, kidnapping, life-threatening medical diagnosis, terrorist attack, and other extreme or life-threatening events. </p> <br>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder can disrupt your whole life ― your job, your relationships, your health and your enjoyment of everyday activities. <br><br>
Having PTSD may also increase your risk of other mental health problems, such as: <br><br>
Depression and anxiety<br><br>
Issues with drugs or alcohol use<br><br>
Eating disorders<br><br>
Suicidal thoughts and actions</p><br><br>
